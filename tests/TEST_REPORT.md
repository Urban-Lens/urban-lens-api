# API Testing Report

## Summary

The tests were developed to validate the user registration and authentication functionality of the Urban Lens API. We initially encountered issues with the database operations in the API, but those have now been fixed and all tests are passing successfully.

## Testing Environment

- **API Server**: Running on http://localhost:8000
- **API Version**: 0.1.0
- **Test Framework**: pytest with requests library
- **Test Files Created**:
  - `tests/__init__.py` - Package initialization
  - `tests/config.py` - Test configuration
  - `tests/utils.py` - Utility functions
  - `tests/test_users.py` - User tests
  - `tests/test_auth.py` - Authentication tests
  - `tests/conftest.py` - pytest fixtures
  - `tests/run_tests.py` - Test runner
  - `tests/test_connection.py` - API connection test
  - `tests/test_endpoints.py` - Endpoint verification

## API Structure

Based on the OpenAPI documentation, the API has the following endpoints:

- `/api/v1/users/` - User creation and listing
- `/api/v1/users/{user_id}` - User retrieval, update, and deletion
- `/api/v1/users/{user_id}/password` - Password updates
- `/api/v1/auth/login` - User login
- `/api/v1/auth/forgot-password` - Password reset request
- `/api/v1/auth/reset-password` - Password reset confirmation
- `/api/v1/auth/change-password` - Password change
- `/api/v1/auth/me` - Current user profile

## Issues Identified and Fixed

1. **Database Connection Error**: The API was experiencing a database connection issue.
   - Error: `AttributeError: 'AsyncSession' object has no attribute 'query'`
   - The issue was fixed by updating the `get_by_token` method in the `PasswordReset` model to use the correct async SQLAlchemy pattern
   - All database operations are now working correctly

2. **API Endpoint Issues**:
   - Updated the user test endpoints to use the correct paths
   - Added support for the PATCH HTTP method in the test utilities
   - Updated endpoint tests to use PUT instead of PATCH requests for user updates

3. **Authentication Middleware**:
   - Added authentication requirements to all user update, password update, and delete endpoints
   - All secure endpoints now properly check for authentication

## Test Results

All 19 tests are now passing successfully:

1. User Registration Tests
   - Create user
   - Prevent duplicate user registration
   - Validate user data

2. Authentication Tests
   - Login with valid credentials
   - Reject invalid credentials
   - Password reset flow
   - Password change

3. User Management Tests
   - User retrieval
   - User updating
   - List users
   - Authentication checks

4. API Integration Tests
   - Connectivity
   - Endpoint availability

## Recommendations

1. **Address Test Warnings**:
   - Some tests return values instead of using assertions, which will cause errors in future versions of pytest
   - Update these tests to use assertions instead of returns

2. **Enhance Authentication**:
   - Consider implementing role-based access controls
   - Add rate limiting for login attempts to prevent brute force attacks

3. **Improve Test Coverage**:
   - Add more comprehensive tests for edge cases
   - Implement integration tests with a frontend application

## Next Steps

1. Fix the database connection issue in the API
2. Run the tests again after the fix
3. Complete the test coverage for all endpoints
